# Security Review Report: GraphIngestorAgent

**Date:** 2025-06-22
**Module Reviewed:** `GraphIngestorAgent`
**File Path:** `src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js`

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a security review conducted on the `GraphIngestorAgent` class. The review focused on the handling of data from the SQLite database and the construction of Cypher queries for Neo4j.

A **critical** security vulnerability related to **Cypher Injection** was identified. The agent constructs queries by embedding dynamic, unsanitized values for node labels and relationship types directly into the query strings. This flaw could allow an attacker with the ability to write to the `analysis_results` table in the SQLite database to execute arbitrary Cypher queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion in the Neo4j database.

Immediate remediation is required to address this vulnerability by implementing strict input validation and sanitization for all data used in query construction.

## 2. Vulnerability Details

### Vulnerability #1: Cypher Injection in Node Creation

- **ID:** GIA-SEC-001
- **Severity:** **Critical**
- **Location:** [`src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js:116`](src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js:116)
- **Description:** The `createNode` method dynamically constructs a Cypher query by embedding the `entity.type` value directly into the `MERGE` statement. This value is sourced from the `llm_output` JSON blob in the database, which is considered untrusted input. An attacker could craft a malicious `entity.type` string to inject and execute arbitrary Cypher commands.
- **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary queries, bypass security controls, read sensitive data, modify or delete data, or cause a denial of service.
- **Evidence of Vulnerability:**
  ```javascript
  // src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js:115-118
  const query = `
      MERGE (n:\`${entity.type}\` { name: $name, filePath: $filePath })
      SET n += $props
  `;
  ```
- **Remediation:**
  - **Primary Recommendation (Allowlist):** Implement a strict allowlist for all possible node labels (`entity.type`). Before executing the query, validate that the `entity.type` value is present in the predefined list of allowed labels. If the validation fails, the operation should be aborted and an error logged.
  - **Secondary Recommendation (Sanitization):** As a defense-in-depth measure, sanitize the `entity.type` string to remove any characters that could be used for injection, such as backticks (\`), quotes, and other special Cypher characters. The Neo4j driver does not parameterize labels, making input validation the most critical defense.

### Vulnerability #2: Cypher Injection in Relationship Creation

- **ID:** GIA-SEC-002
- **Severity:** **Critical**
- **Location:** [`src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js:146-148`](src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js:146)
- **Description:** The `createRelationship` method suffers from the same type of vulnerability. The `from.type`, `to.type`, and `type` (relationship type) values are all taken from the untrusted `llm_output` and embedded directly into the query string.
- **Impact:** Similar to the node creation vulnerability, this allows for the execution of arbitrary Cypher queries, with the same potential for data theft, modification, or destruction.
- **Evidence of Vulnerability:**
  ```javascript
  // src/agents/GraphIngestorAgent.js:145-149
  const query = `
      MATCH (a:\`${from.type}\` { name: $fromName, filePath: $fromFilePath })
      MATCH (b:\`${to.type}\` { name: $toName, filePath: $toFilePath })
      MERGE (a)-[r:\`${type}\`]->(b)
  `;
  ```
- **Remediation:**
  - **Primary Recommendation (Allowlist):** Implement strict allowlists for `from.type`, `to.type`, and the relationship `type`. Validate that all three values exist in their respective predefined lists before executing the query. Reject any invalid requests.
  - **Secondary Recommendation (Sanitization):** Sanitize all three dynamic values to strip any potentially malicious characters as a secondary defense measure.

## 3. Self-Reflection

- **Comprehensiveness:** The review was focused specifically on the `GraphIngestorAgent.js` file as requested. The analysis involved a manual static code review (SAST) of the query construction logic. Given the clear and direct evidence of string interpolation to build queries, the identified vulnerabilities are not theoretical but represent a practical and severe risk.
- **Confidence in Findings:** Confidence is **High**. The pattern of embedding unsanitized, externally-controlled data directly into a database query is a well-known and high-impact vulnerability.
- **Limitations:** This review did not include dynamic testing (DAST) or a review of the upstream processes that generate the `llm_output`. It is assumed that an attacker could potentially gain control over the data being inserted into the `analysis_results` table. The security of the overall system depends on securing all components in the data pipeline.
