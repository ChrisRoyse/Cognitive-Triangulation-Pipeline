# End-to-End Acceptance Test Results

**Date:** 2025-06-17
**Status:** ALL TESTS PASSED

This report summarizes the execution of the high-level acceptance tests for the Universal Code Graph V3 pipeline, as defined in the [`MasterAcceptanceTestPlan.md`](../tests/MasterAcceptanceTestPlan.md). The tests were executed against the fully integrated system to verify its end-to-end functionality.

## 1. Test Execution Summary

The full suite of acceptance tests was executed using the command: `npm test -- tests/acceptance/`.

- **Total Test Suites:** 4 passed
- **Total Tests:** 6 passed
- **Overall Result:** **SUCCESS**

The successful execution of these tests confirms that the system meets the core objectives outlined in the acceptance plan, demonstrating its capability to process repositories, handle updates, maintain graph correctness, and exhibit resilience to errors.

## 2. Detailed Results by Test Suite

The following sections detail the outcomes of each test suite, corresponding to the key user stories and system flows defined in the Master Acceptance Test Plan.

### 2.1. `initial_clone_processing.test.js` (PASSED)

- **Objective:** Verify the system's ability to correctly process a "greenfield" repository from a clean slate.
- **Outcome:** The tests in this suite passed, confirming that the pipeline can successfully clone, analyze, and generate a complete and accurate knowledge graph for a new repository without any pre-existing state. This validates the AI-verifiable success criteria for SQLite state and Neo4j graph state for initial processing.

### 2.2. `repository_update_processing.test.js` (PASSED)

- **Objective:** Verify the system's ability to accurately detect and process incremental changes.
- **Outcome:** The tests in this suite passed, demonstrating that the `ScoutAgent` correctly identifies file additions, modifications, and deletions, and that the downstream agents process these changes to accurately update the knowledge graph.

### 2.3. `graph_correctness.test.js` (PASSED)

- **Objective:** Verify that the final Neo4j graph precisely matches a pre-defined "golden" state.
- **Outcome:** The tests in this suite passed, confirming the structural and semantic integrity of the generated graph. Assertions for node counts, relationship counts, and specific path existence all passed, verifying that the graph fidelity meets the project's stringent requirements.

### 2.4. `error_resilience.test.js` (PASSED)

- **Objective:** Verify the system's robustness against predictable failures.
- **Outcome:** The tests in this suite passed, showing that the pipeline can gracefully handle simulated failures such as LLM API errors and malformed data. The system correctly isolated the failed work into the `failed_work` table without halting the entire process, demonstrating effective error resilience and recovery.

## 3. Conclusion

The 100% pass rate across all acceptance test suites provides high confidence that the Universal Code Graph V3 system is functioning as designed. The core requirements for initial processing, incremental updates, graph correctness, and error resilience have been met. The system adheres to the AI-verifiable success criteria, and no regressions were identified. This successful test run marks a significant milestone, confirming the system's readiness and stability.
