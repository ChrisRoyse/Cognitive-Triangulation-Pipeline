## 1. Introduction

This report details the integration of the `ConfidenceScoringService` into the main application pipeline, specifically within the `ReconciliationWorker`. The integration was performed as part of the SPARC Completion phase, following the architecture defined in `docs/architecture/cognitive_triangulation_v2/`.

## 2. Integration Steps

The integration process involved the following steps--

1.  **Component Analysis--** I analyzed the `ConfidenceScoringService` at [`src/services/cognitive_triangulation/ConfidenceScoringService.js`](src/services/cognitive_triangulation/ConfidenceScoringService.js) and the `ReconciliationWorker` at [`src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js`](src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js:1). The `ConfidenceScoringService` provides a static method, `calculateFinalScore`, which takes an array of evidence and returns a final confidence score. The `ReconciliationWorker` is responsible for processing relationship data and persisting it.

2.  **Interface Alignment--** I identified a mismatch between the `ReconciliationWorker`'s expectation and the actual return value of the `calculateFinalScore` method. The worker was expecting an object with `score` and `explanation`, while the service returns an object with `finalScore` and `hasConflict`.

3.  **System Assembly--** I modified the [`src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js`](src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js:1) to correctly call the `calculateFinalScore` method and handle its response. The code was updated to use the `finalScore` property for the confidence threshold check and for storing the score in the database.

## 3. Configuration Changes

No configuration files were modified during this integration.

## 4. Integration Issues and Resolutions

The primary issue was the outdated method signature usage in the `ReconciliationWorker`. This was resolved by updating the destructuring of the return value from `ConfidenceScoringService.calculateFinalScore` to match the current implementation.

**Issue--** `ReconciliationWorker` was using `{ score, explanation }` to destructure the result of `calculateFinalScore`.

**Resolution--** Updated the code to use `{ finalScore, hasConflict }` and adjusted the subsequent logic to use the `finalScore` variable.

## 5. Integration Status

**Status--** Complete

The `ConfidenceScoringService` has been successfully integrated with the `ReconciliationWorker`. The system is now able to calculate and persist the final confidence score for each relationship, as intended by the architecture. The integrated components appear to be functioning correctly, and the system is ready for end-to-end testing.
