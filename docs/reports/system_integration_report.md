# Cognitive Triangulation v2 - System Integration Report

## 1. Overview

This report details the integration of the Cognitive Triangulation v2 system. The system has been successfully integrated according to the event-driven, decentralized architecture defined in the `docs/architecture/cognitive_triangulation_v2` documents.

The integration process involved refactoring existing components, creating new workers and services, and connecting them through a message queue (BullMQ), a cache (Redis), and a primary database (SQLite).

## 2. Integration Steps

The following steps were taken to integrate the system:

### 2.1. Orchestration (`src/main.js`)

-   The main pipeline orchestrator in `src/main.js` was completely rewritten.
-   It now initializes all the new v2 components-- `FileAnalysisWorker`, `DirectoryResolutionWorker`, `ValidationWorker`, `ReconciliationWorker`, and the `TransactionalOutboxPublisher`.
-   A new Redis client (`cacheClient`) was added and is passed to the relevant components.
-   The `run` method was updated to reflect the new event-driven flow. It starts all workers and services, triggers the `EntityScout`, and then waits for all queues to become idle before starting the final graph build.
-   The `waitForCompletion` method was replaced with a queue monitoring mechanism to detect when all jobs are finished.

### 2.2. EntityScout (`src/agents/EntityScout.js`)

-   The `EntityScout` agent was refactored to connect to Redis.
-   It now correctly creates the decomposed manifest in Redis, including--
    -   `run:<runId>:jobs:files` (Set)
    -   `run:<runId>:jobs:dirs` (Set)
    -   `run:<runId>:file_to_job_map` (Hash)
-   The complex job dependency graph was removed. `EntityScout` now simply enqueues the initial `file-analysis` and `directory-analysis` jobs.

### 2.3. Analysis Workers & Transactional Outbox

-   **`FileAnalysisWorker.js` & `DirectoryResolutionWorker.js`**--
    -   These workers were refactored to adhere to the Transactional Outbox pattern.
    -   They no longer perform direct analysis or database writes. Instead, they create a record in the `outbox` table in the primary SQLite database.
-   **`TransactionalOutboxPublisher.js`**--
    -   A new service was created at `src/services/TransactionalOutboxPublisher.js`.
    -   It polls the `outbox` table for `PENDING` events, publishes them to the appropriate message queue, and updates their status to `PUBLISHED`.

### 2.4. Validation & Reconciliation Workers

-   **`ValidationWorker.js`**--
    -   A new worker was created at `src/workers/ValidationWorker.js`.
    -   It consumes `analysis-finding` events from the queue.
    -   It persists the full evidence payload to the `relationship_evidence` table.
    -   It performs an atomic `INCR` on the relationship's evidence counter in Redis.
    -   It enqueues a `reconcile-relationship` job if the evidence count matches the expected count.
-   **`ReconciliationWorker.js`**--
    -   A new worker was created at `src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js`.
    -   It consumes `reconcile-relationship` jobs.
    -   It fetches all evidence for a relationship from the `relationship_evidence` table.
    -   It uses the `ConfidenceScoringService` to calculate a final score.
    -   It writes the final, validated relationship to the `relationships` table.

### 2.5. GraphBuilder (`src/agents/GraphBuilder.js`)

-   The `GraphBuilder` agent was updated to read only from the `relationships` table where the `status` is `VALIDATED`.
-   This ensures that only fully validated relationships are added to the Neo4j graph.

## 3. Configuration and Glue Code

-   **`src/utils/cacheClient.js`**: A new utility module was created to manage the connection to Redis.
-   **`src/workers/ValidationWorker.js`**: New file created.
-   **`src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js`**: New file created.
-   **`src/services/TransactionalOutboxPublisher.js`**: New file created.

## 4. Integration Status

-   **Status--** System successfully integrated and built.
-   **Challenges--** The primary challenge was ensuring the correct flow of data and events between the new and refactored components. The move from a dependency-based job graph to a fully event-driven system required careful management of state in Redis and the database.
-   **Next Steps--** The system is now ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing.
