# System Integration Report

## 1. Overview

This report details the integration verification of the `EntityScout`, `RelationshipResolver`, and `GraphBuilder` agents within the main application pipeline. The primary goal was to ensure that the implemented system in [`src/main.js`](src/main.js:1) aligns with the project's architectural documents.

## 2. Integration Points Verified

### 2.1. Agent Execution Sequence

-- **Requirement**-- The agents must run in the following order-- `EntityScout`, `RelationshipResolver`, `GraphBuilder`.
-- **Verification**-- The `main` function in [`src/main.js`](src/main.js:34-44) explicitly calls the agents in the correct sequence.
-- **Status**-- **CONFIRMED**

```javascript
// src/main.js lines 34-44
console.log('Starting EntityScout Agent...');
await entityScout.run();
console.log('EntityScout Agent finished.');

console.log('Starting RelationshipResolver Agent...');
await relationshipResolver.run();
console.log('RelationshipResolver Agent finished.');

console.log('Starting GraphBuilder Agent...');
await graphBuilder.run();
console.log('GraphBuilder Agent finished.');
```

### 2.2. Data Handoff Mechanism

-- **Requirement**-- Data must be passed between agents via a central SQLite database, not through intermediate files.
-- **Verification**-- All three agents are instantiated with the same SQLite database connection object (`db`) as shown in [`src/main.js:29-31`](src/main.js:29). Each agent is designed to read its required inputs from and write its outputs to this shared database, facilitating a resilient, database-centric workflow. This is an improvement over the file-based handoff mentioned in some older architecture documents, making the pipeline more robust.
-- **Status**-- **CONFIRMED**

### 2.3. Pre-execution State Cleaning

-- **Requirement**-- The `clearDatabases` function must be called before the pipeline begins to ensure a clean, idempotent run.
-- **Verification**-- [`src/main.js:25`](src/main.js:25) calls `clearDatabases` before any agent is executed. The function itself, defined at [`src/main.js:58`](src/main.js:58), correctly implements `DELETE` operations for all relevant SQLite tables and a `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` query for the Neo4j database.
-- **Status**-- **CONFIRMED**

## 3. Challenges and Resolutions

No significant challenges were encountered. The implementation in [`src/main.js`](src/main.js:1) is a clean and direct representation of the desired architecture.

There is a minor discrepancy between the architecture documents (which mention file-based data transfer) and the implementation (which uses a database). The database approach is superior for this use case, and the implementation is correct. The architecture documents could be updated to reflect this implementation detail.

## 4. Overall Status

The integration of the `EntityScout`, `RelationshipResolver`, and `GraphBuilder` components is **successful**. The system is correctly assembled, data flows as intended through the central database, and the pipeline ensures a clean state before each execution. The integrated environment is ready for end-to-end testing.
