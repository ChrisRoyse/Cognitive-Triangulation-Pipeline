# Diagnosis Report-- Neo4j Connection Failure for SelfCleaningAgent

**Date--** 2025-06-24

**Feature Under Investigation--** `SelfCleaningAgent`

## 1. Summary

The functional tests for the `SelfCleaningAgent` are failing due to a `Neo4jError: Connection was closed by server`. Initial analysis suspected an issue within the agent's implementation. However, further investigation using a baseline connection script (`test_neo4j_connection.js`) has isolated the problem to a fundamental failure in the Neo4j database connection from the Node.js environment.

## 2. Debugging Process and Findings

### Step 1-- Reproduce the Issue

The initial failure was reported in the functional tests for [`tests/functional/self_cleaning_agent.test.js`](tests/functional/self_cleaning_agent.test.js).

### Step 2-- Isolate the Problem

To determine if the fault was within the `SelfCleaningAgent` or the database connection itself, the `test_neo4j_connection.js` script was executed. This script attempts a direct, minimal connection to the Neo4j server, bypassing the agent's logic.

**Command Executed--**
```bash
node test_neo4j_connection.js
```

**Output--**
```
Environment variables:
NEO4J_URI: bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER: neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD: ***
NEO4J_DATABASE: backend

Testing driver connectivity...
âœ— Connection failed: Connection was closed by server
Error details: Neo4jError: Connection was closed by server
...
  code: 'ServiceUnavailable',
  retriable: true
}
```

### Step 3-- Analyze the Findings

The output from the baseline test script confirms that the connection failure is not specific to the `SelfCleaningAgent`. The `ServiceUnavailable` error code indicates that the Node.js application cannot establish a stable connection to the Neo4j server at the specified URI (`bolt://localhost:7687`).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the test failures is a systemic issue with the Neo4j database connection. The problem is not in the application code but in the environment or the database server itself.

**Potential Causes--**
1.  **Neo4j Server is Not Running--** The database server may be stopped or has crashed.
2.  **Incorrect Connection URI--** The application is trying to connect to `bolt://localhost:7687`, which might be incorrect if the server is hosted elsewhere or on a different port.
3.  **Firewall or Network Issues--** A firewall on the local machine or network might be blocking the connection to port 7687.
4.  **Incorrect Credentials--** The `NEO4J_USER` or `NEO4J_PASSWORD` environment variables might be incorrect, causing the server to reject the authentication attempt and close the connection.
5.  **Incorrect Database Name--** The specified `NEO4J_DATABASE` ('backend') may not exist on the server.
6.  **Neo4j Server Configuration--** The server might not be configured to accept remote or bolt connections.

## 4. Recommended Actions and Verification

The following steps should be taken by a human developer to diagnose and resolve the issue.

1.  **Verify Neo4j Server Status--** Check if the Neo4j database process is running on the machine where the tests are being executed.
2.  **Check Neo4j Logs--** Inspect the Neo4j server logs for any errors that coincide with the connection attempts. This can provide specific details about why the connection is being terminated.
3.  **Test Connection with `cypher-shell`--** Use the native `cypher-shell` or Neo4j Browser to attempt a connection with the same credentials and database name to confirm they are valid.
4.  **Review Environment Variables--** Double-check the `.env` file or the environment configuration to ensure `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, and `NEO4J_DATABASE` are set correctly.
5.  **Check Network and Firewall--** Ensure that no firewall rules are preventing connection to `localhost` on port `7687`.

Once the underlying connection issue is resolved, the `test_neo4j_connection.js` script should be run again. A successful execution will indicate that the environment is correctly configured, and the `SelfCleaningAgent` functional tests can be re-run.
