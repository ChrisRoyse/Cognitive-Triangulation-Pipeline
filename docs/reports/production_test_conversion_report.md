# Production Test Conversion Implementation Report

## 1. Overview

This report details the successful conversion of the project's granular, mock-based tests into production-ready integration tests. The conversion was executed according to the `production_test_conversion_plan.md`. All tests for `ScoutAgent`, `WorkerAgent`, and `GraphIngestorAgent` now interact with real system components, including the file system, a SQLite database, and a Neo4j graph database, using a "golden" dataset strategy to ensure determinism.

## 2. Converted Test Files

The following test files in the `tests/granular/` directory have been modified:

*   `tests/granular/ScoutAgent.test.js`
*   `tests/granular/WorkerAgent.test.js`
*   `tests/granular/GraphIngestorAgent.test.js`

## 3. Summary of Changes per Agent

### 3.1. ScoutAgent

*   **Mocks Removed**: `MockFileSystem` and `MockDatabaseConnector` were completely removed.
*   **Real Components Used**: Tests now use the native Node.js `fs` module to interact with a temporary directory created for each test run. All database interactions are performed against a live SQLite database using the project's real database module (`src/utils/sqliteDb.js`).
*   **Test Logic**:
    *   A `beforeEach` block now handles the creation of a temporary repository directory and the cleaning of relevant database tables (`work_queue`, `file_state`, etc.).
    *   An `afterEach` block ensures the temporary directory is removed.
    *   Assertions were changed from inspecting mock call arrays to executing live `SELECT` queries against the SQLite database to verify that files are correctly identified and queued.

### 3.2. WorkerAgent

*   **Mocks Removed**: The mock `db` and `fs` objects were removed.
*   **Real Components Used**: Tests use the real `fs` and `sqliteDb` modules.
*   **Golden Data Strategy**: The `LlmClient`'s `call` method is strategically mocked using `jest.fn()` to return a predefined "golden" JSON response. This isolates the test from network dependencies while still testing the full logic of the agent, including file reading, response parsing, and persistence.
*   **Test Logic**:
    *   A `setupTask` helper function was created to write a test file to a temporary directory and insert a corresponding task into the real `work_queue` table.
    *   Assertions now query the `analysis_results` and `failed_work` tables in the live SQLite database to confirm that the agent correctly processes the golden data and handles various success and failure scenarios.

### 3.3. GraphIngestorAgent

*   **Mocks Removed**: The mock `sqliteDb` and `neo4jDriver` were removed.
*   **Real Components Used**: Tests now use the real `sqliteDb` and `neo4jDriver` modules, requiring a live, locally running Neo4j instance to be present for the tests to pass.
*   **Test Logic**:
    *   A `beforeAll` block verifies connectivity to the Neo4j database.
    *   A `beforeEach` block clears both the SQLite and Neo4j databases to ensure test isolation.
    *   A `setupAnalysisResult` helper function populates the `analysis_results` table with "golden" data.
    *   The core test logic now calls the exported `processBatch` function directly.
    *   Assertions were updated to execute live Cypher queries against the Neo4j database to validate the resulting graph structure (nodes and relationships) and to query the SQLite database to confirm that task statuses are correctly updated.

## 4. Challenges and Resolutions

The primary challenge was ensuring the correct usage of the real database modules, which differed slightly from the mock interfaces. This was resolved by:

1.  Reading the source files for `sqliteDb.js` and `initializeDb.js` to understand their exported functions.
2.  Correcting the import statements and function calls in the test files. For instance, `db.query()` was replaced with the correct `db.execute()` or `db.querySingle()`, and `initializeDb()` was corrected to `initializeDb.initialize()`.
3.  Adjusting the test for `GraphIngestorAgent` to call the exported `processBatch` function instead of a non-existent class.

This iterative process of running, observing errors, and correcting the implementation based on the actual source code was crucial for the successful conversion.

## 5. Conclusion

The test suite is now significantly more robust and provides higher fidelity by testing the actual integration points between the agents and the data stores. This conversion successfully meets the goals outlined in the test plan.
