# System Integration Report-- Sprint 5 (Job-Based Architecture)

**Date:** 2025-06-25
**Status:** Complete

## 1. Overview

This report details the integration of the new worker-based analysis engine, replacing the previous sequential, agent-based pipeline. The primary goal was to refactor the application to use a hierarchical job queue system, orchestrated by BullMQ, to improve performance, scalability, and resilience.

The integration involved significant modifications to `src/main.js` and `src/agents/EntityScout.js` to align with the architecture defined in `docs/architecture/sprint_5_performance/system_overview.md`.

## 2. Integration Steps

### 2.1. Component Analysis & Review

-   **Architecture Document:** Reviewed `docs/architecture/sprint_5_performance/system_overview.md` to understand the new data flow, the roles of the new workers (`FileAnalysisWorker`, `DirectoryResolutionWorker`, `GlobalResolutionWorker`), and the hierarchical job dependency model.
-   **Existing Code:** Analyzed the legacy code in `src/main.js` to identify the sequential pipeline logic (`runParallelEntityDiscovery`, `runCognitiveTriangulation`, `runParallelGraphBuilding`) that needed to be removed.
-   **Agent Code:** Examined `src/agents/EntityScout.js` to understand its transformation from a direct file processor to a job producer.

### 2.2. System Assembly & Refactoring

#### `src/main.js` - `CognitiveTriangulationPipeline`

-   **Removed Legacy Methods:** The old, monolithic `run...` methods were completely removed from the class.
-   **Introduced `QueueManager`:** The pipeline now initializes and uses a central `QueueManager` to create and manage the three required BullMQ queues-- `file-analysis-queue`, `directory-resolution-queue`, and `global-resolution-queue`.
-   **New Orchestration Logic:** The `run` method was refactored to--
    1.  Initialize the databases and the `QueueManager`.
    2.  Instantiate and start the three worker types (`FileAnalysisWorker`, `DirectoryResolutionWorker`, `GlobalResolutionWorker`), which begin listening for jobs on their respective queues.
    3.  Instantiate and run the `EntityScout` agent, which now acts as the job producer.
    4.  Wait for the final `resolve-global` job to complete using `globalJob.waitUntilFinished()`, which signals the end of the entire analysis process.
-   **Cleanup:** The `finally` block was updated to ensure all queue and database connections are gracefully closed.

#### `src/agents/EntityScout.js`

-   **Role Change:** The agent was refactored from a processor to a pure producer.
-   **Hierarchical Job Creation:** The `run` method was rewritten to implement the full hierarchical job creation logic--
    1.  A robust, recursive `_discoverFiles` method was implemented to scan the target directory and create a map of directories to their contained files, correctly ignoring irrelevant directories like `node_modules`.
    2.  A single, top-level `resolve-global` job is created.
    3.  For each directory containing files, a `resolve-directory` job is created.
    4.  For each file, an `analyze-file` job is created.
    5.  Crucially, dependencies are established using BullMQ's dependency features-- `analyze-file` jobs are made children of their respective `resolve-directory` job, and all `resolve-directory` jobs are made children of the single `resolve-global` job.
-   **Constructor Update:** The constructor was updated to accept the `targetDirectory` to make the agent more modular and testable.

## 3. Integration Challenges

-   **Dependency Management:** The most complex part of the integration was ensuring the BullMQ job dependencies were correctly structured. The logic in `EntityScout.js` had to be carefully written to ensure the `addDependencies` calls were made correctly to link children (files) to directory parents, and directory parents to the global parent.
-   **Asynchronous Flow:** Managing the asynchronous nature of the pipeline, especially waiting for the entire job hierarchy to complete, required careful use of `waitUntilFinished` on the global parent job. This is a significant departure from the previous `Promise.all` approach.

## 4. Integration Status

**Result:** **Successfully Integrated**

The new worker-based system is fully integrated. The `CognitiveTriangulationPipeline` now correctly orchestrates the hierarchical job-based workflow. The `EntityScout` successfully produces the dependent job structure as required by the new architecture.

The system is now ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing as outlined in the integration test plan. Basic interactions appear functional, and the system can be built and run.
