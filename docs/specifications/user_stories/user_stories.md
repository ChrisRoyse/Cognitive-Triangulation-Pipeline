# User Stories - Cognitive Triangulation Architecture

## Epic 1: Entity Discovery and Extraction

### Story 1.1: Comprehensive Entity Analysis
*   **As a developer,** I want the system to analyze my codebase using EntityScout to extract all meaningful code entities (functions, classes, variables, files) so that I can understand the complete structure of my project.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   EntityScout processes every source file identified in the target directory.
    *   All entities are extracted with accurate type classification (Function, Class, Variable, File, Database, Table, View).
    *   Entity extraction works across multiple programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.).
    *   Results are stored in SQLite with proper schema validation.

### Story 1.2: Configurable File Discovery
*   **As a developer,** I want to configure which files and directories are included or excluded from analysis so that I can focus on relevant code and ignore build artifacts or dependencies.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Given a configuration file specifying `node_modules/` and `*.md` to be excluded, EntityScout does not select any files from those locations or with those patterns.
    *   The configuration supports both inclusion and exclusion patterns.
    *   The system provides clear feedback about which files were included/excluded and why.

## Epic 2: Knowledge Graph Construction

### Story 2.1: Accurate Graph Database Population
*   **As a developer,** I want GraphBuilder to create a comprehensive Neo4j knowledge graph from the extracted entities so that I can visualize and query the relationships in my codebase.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   All entities from EntityScout reports are accurately represented as nodes in Neo4j.
    *   Initial relationships are created based on the entity extraction analysis.
    *   The graph structure follows the defined schema with proper node types and relationship types.
    *   The ingestion process handles large codebases efficiently without memory issues.

### Story 2.2: Schema Compliance and Data Integrity
*   **As a data consumer,** I want to ensure that the Neo4j graph adheres to a consistent schema so that my queries and visualizations work reliably.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   All nodes and relationships created by GraphBuilder adhere strictly to the defined types, properties, and constraints.
    *   The ingestion process is idempotent: running GraphBuilder multiple times on the same input data results in the exact same final graph state.
    *   Data integrity checks validate that no orphaned relationships or malformed nodes exist.

## Epic 3: Cognitive Triangulation Analysis

### Story 3.1: Enhanced Relationship Discovery
*   **As a developer,** I want RelationshipResolver to use cognitive triangulation to discover and validate complex relationships between code entities that weren't apparent from initial analysis.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   RelationshipResolver analyzes the existing graph and entity reports to identify additional relationships.
    *   The system detects cross-file dependencies, API call patterns, and data flow relationships.
    *   Relationship confidence scores are calculated and stored for quality assessment.
    *   The cognitive triangulation process improves relationship accuracy by at least 25% over basic extraction.

## Epic 4: Performance and Scalability

### Story 4.1: Efficient Pipeline Processing
*   **As a developer,** I want the cognitive triangulation pipeline to process large codebases efficiently so that I can analyze enterprise-scale projects.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   EntityScout processes multiple files efficiently using proper file I/O patterns.
    *   GraphBuilder uses optimized Neo4j transactions to handle large datasets.
    *   RelationshipResolver completes analysis within reasonable time bounds for typical projects.
    *   The intermediate SQLite database correctly stores all analysis results before graph construction begins.

## Epic 5: System Reliability and Monitoring

### Story 5.1: Pipeline Monitoring and Progress Tracking
*   **As a developer,** I want real-time visibility into the cognitive triangulation pipeline progress so that I can monitor long-running analyses and identify any issues.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system provides progress updates for each phase: EntityScout, GraphBuilder, RelationshipResolver.
    *   WebSocket API delivers real-time status updates to connected clients.
    *   Error handling provides clear diagnostic information when components fail.
    *   The pipeline supports graceful shutdown and resume capabilities.

### Story 5.2: Quality Assurance and Validation
*   **As a developer,** I want the system to validate the quality and completeness of the generated knowledge graph so that I can trust the analysis results.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Comprehensive test suites validate each component: functional tests for each agent, acceptance tests for end-to-end scenarios.
    *   The system detects and reports on unrelated files that don't connect to the main dependency graph.
    *   Relationship quality metrics help identify areas where the analysis may be incomplete or uncertain.
    *   Ground truth validation ensures the cognitive triangulation approach produces accurate results.
