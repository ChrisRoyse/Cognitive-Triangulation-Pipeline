# Cognitive Triangulation Pipeline - State of the World Testing

This document describes the comprehensive testing system for validating the Cognitive Triangulation Pipeline against established benchmarks and ensuring consistent performance.

## Overview

The state-of-the-world testing system validates that the pipeline produces the exact expected database states when processing the `polyglot-test` directory. It provides:

- **Precise Benchmark Validation**: Tests against exact counts and distributions
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Tracks performance over time
- **Regression Detection**: Identifies performance degradations
- **Cross-Language Validation**: Ensures polyglot relationship detection
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates actionable insights

## Quick Start

### Basic Pipeline Test
```bash
# Run complete pipeline test with validation
npm run test:pipeline

# Verbose output for debugging
npm run test:pipeline:verbose

# Dry run to validate setup without execution
npm run pipeline:dry-run
```

### Individual Component Testing
```bash
# Test only SQLite database state
npm run test:sqlite

# Test only Neo4j graph state  
npm run test:neo4j

# Test both databases
npm run validate:state

# Benchmark comparison only (no pipeline execution)
npm run test:benchmark
```

### Advanced Testing
```bash
# Reliability testing (multiple runs)
npm run pipeline:reliability

# Continuous monitoring mode
npm run test:pipeline:continuous
```

## Test Components

### 1. Pipeline Runner (`tests/pipeline_runner.js`)

Orchestrates complete pipeline execution and validation:

- Cleans previous state
- Runs pipeline on polyglot-test directory
- Validates resulting database states
- Generates comprehensive reports

**Usage:**
```javascript
const PipelineRunner = require('./tests/pipeline_runner');

const runner = new PipelineRunner({
    testDirectory: './polyglot-test',
    sqliteDbPath: './cognitive_graph.db',
    neo4jUri: 'bolt://localhost:7687',
    timeout: 300000,
    verbose: true
});

const results = await runner.run();
console.log(`Score: ${results.overallScore}/100`);
```

### 2. SQLite State Validator (`tests/sqlite_state_validator.js`)

Validates SQLite database against polyglot-test benchmarks:

**Expected State:**
- **files**: 15 rows (processed files)
- **pois**: 417 rows (extracted entities)
- **relationships**: 870 rows (entity relationships)
- **POI Distribution**: Functions (235), Classes (21), Variables (41), Imports (66)
- **Relationship Types**: CONTAINS (402), CALLS (150), USES (100), IMPORTS (66)

**Validation Includes:**
- Table row counts vs benchmarks
- Data quality checks (no orphaned relationships, valid line numbers)
- POI type distribution analysis
- Relationship type distribution analysis
- Data integrity verification

### 3. Neo4j State Validator (`tests/neo4j_state_validator.js`)

Validates Neo4j graph against polyglot-test benchmarks:

**Expected State:**
- **Total Nodes**: 417 (matching SQLite POIs)
- **Total Relationships**: 870 (2.1x node ratio)
- **Cross-Language Patterns**: JS-to-Python calls, SQL references, inheritance chains
- **Graph Integrity**: No isolated nodes, proper relationship ratios

**Validation Includes:**
- Node and relationship counts
- Cross-language relationship detection
- Graph structure integrity
- Property validation

### 4. Benchmark Comparator (`tests/benchmark_comparator.js`)

Advanced analysis system providing:

- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Performance tracking over time
- **Regression Detection**: Identifies performance drops
- **Recommendation Engine**: Actionable improvement suggestions
- **Alert System**: Critical issue notifications

## Polyglot-Test Benchmark

The `polyglot-test` directory contains a carefully crafted codebase that exercises all pipeline capabilities:

### File Structure
```
polyglot-test/
â”œâ”€â”€ javascript/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway.js          # Express API with user endpoints
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frontend-app.js         # React frontend components
â”œâ”€â”€ python/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ml-service.py           # ML model with sklearn
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data-processor.py       # Data processing utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ java/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DataProcessor.java      # Java data processing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ApiClient.java          # HTTP client for API calls
â””â”€â”€ sql/
    â”œâ”€â”€ schema.sql              # Database tables and indexes
    â”œâ”€â”€ views.sql               # Database views
    â””â”€â”€ triggers.sql            # Database triggers
```

### Expected Extraction Counts

| Entity Type | Count | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Functions   | 235   | All functions/methods across languages |
| Classes     | 21    | Class definitions |
| Variables   | 41    | Module-level variables/constants |
| Imports     | 66    | Import/require statements |
| Tables      | 25    | SQL table definitions |
| Relationships | 870 | Total entity relationships |

### Critical Validation Points

1. **Cross-Language API Calls**: JavaScript calling Python ML service
2. **Database References**: Code referencing SQL schema entities
3. **Inheritance Chains**: Python class inheritance detection
4. **Import Resolution**: Cross-file dependency tracking

## Test Execution Workflow

### 1. Pre-flight Checks
- Validates test directory structure
- Confirms database connectivity
- Checks pipeline entry points

### 2. State Cleanup
- Removes previous SQLite database
- Clears Neo4j graph data
- Cleans temporary files

### 3. Pipeline Execution
- Runs pipeline with environment variables:
  ```bash
  NODE_ENV=test
  TEST_MODE=true
  TARGET_DIRECTORY=./polyglot-test
  ```
- Monitors execution with timeout
- Captures output for metrics extraction

### 4. Database Validation
- SQLite: Table counts, data quality, distributions
- Neo4j: Graph structure, relationships, cross-language patterns

### 5. Report Generation
- JSON reports for automation
- Markdown summaries for humans
- Historical trend analysis
- Regression detection
