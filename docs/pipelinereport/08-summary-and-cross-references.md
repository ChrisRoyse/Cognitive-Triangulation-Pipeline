## Data Models Quick Reference

### POI (Point of Interest)
```javascript
{
  name: string,          // Entity name
  type: string,          // ClassDefinition, FunctionDefinition, etc.
  semantic_id: string,   // Unique identifier
  file_path: string,     // Source location
  start_line: number,    // Position in file
  end_line: number,
  description: string,   // Semantic description
  is_exported: boolean   // Public/private
}
```

### Relationship
```javascript
{
  from: string,          // Source entity
  to: string,            // Target entity
  type: string,          // CALLS, USES, IMPLEMENTS, etc.
  confidence: number,    // 0.0 to 1.0
  reason: string,        // Evidence/reasoning
  evidence: object[]     // Supporting data
}
```

## Configuration Quick Reference

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
SQLITE_DB_PATH=./data/database.db
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Performance
MAX_FILE_ANALYSIS_WORKERS=100
FORCE_MAX_CONCURRENCY=50
CPU_THRESHOLD=90
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=85

# Triangulation
TRIANGULATION_THRESHOLD=0.45
TRIANGULATION_CONCURRENCY=2

# Timeout Protection
LLM_TIMEOUT_MS=120000
```

### Key Thresholds
- High Confidence: > 0.85
- Medium Confidence: 0.65 - 0.85
- Low Confidence: 0.45 - 0.65
- Triangulation Trigger: < 0.45

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
- File Analysis: 100 concurrent workers max
- Relationship Resolution: 100 concurrent workers max
- Triangulation: 2 concurrent sessions (resource-intensive)
- Graph Building: 500 relationships per batch

### Resource Usage
- Memory: ~1-2GB baseline + worker overhead
- CPU: Scales with worker concurrency
- Disk I/O: WAL mode for concurrent SQLite access
- Network: Batch operations minimize overhead

## Common Operations

### Starting the Pipeline
```javascript
const pipeline = new CognitiveTriangulationPipeline(targetDirectory);
await pipeline.run();
```

### Monitoring Progress
- Queue depths via Redis
- Database queries for counts
- Log analysis for errors
- Performance metrics collection

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
1. **Queue Backlog**: Increase worker concurrency
2. **High Memory**: Reduce batch sizes
3. **Slow Processing**: Check LLM rate limits
4. **Failed Jobs**: Review error categorization
5. **Hanging Operations**: Check 120-second LLM timeouts
6. **Circuit Breaker Issues**: Use `resetAllCircuitBreakers()` method
7. **Cache Dependencies**: System now operates in no-cache mode
