# Identified Patterns (Part 1)

Based on the initial data collection, several key patterns have emerged that will guide the subsequent research and recommendations.

## 1. The "Hybrid Approach" Pattern

*   **Observation:** For both the Scout Agent (file identification) and the Worker Agent (code analysis), a purely traditional or purely AI-driven approach is insufficient. The most effective strategy consistently involves a hybrid model.
*   **Scout Agent:** Combines fast, rule-based methods (file extensions, directory names) for the majority of cases with slower, more sophisticated AI-based analysis for ambiguous edge cases.
*   **Worker Agent:** While the core requirement is to avoid ASTs, the research suggests that a hybrid of rule-based pattern matching (for identifying potential entities) and LLM-based analysis (for validation and relationship extraction) could be highly effective. The "noisy" nature of pure LLM output is a recurring theme, and pre-processing or post-processing steps are a common pattern to mitigate this.

## 2. The "Fine-Tuning for Accuracy" Pattern

*   **Observation:** While general-purpose LLMs can perform code analysis tasks with prompting, the consistent message is that fine-tuning is necessary to achieve the high degree of accuracy required for this project.
*   **Reasoning:** Code has a strict, unambiguous syntax. Fine-tuning allows a model to become highly specialized in the specific grammar and common patterns of a programming language, reducing "hallucinations" and improving the reliability of the output. This is particularly true for handling language-specific complexities like Python's indentation or Java's type system.

## 3. The "Schema-First, Batch Ingestion" Pattern for Neo4j

*   **Observation:** The approach to Neo4j ingestion is highly consistent across sources. Success depends on a well-defined process that prioritizes schema design and efficient data handling.
*   **Key Steps:**
    1.  **Define the Schema:** A clear, logical graph model is the essential first step.
    2.  **Pre-process Data:** Raw data (like JSON) is rarely in the ideal format for ingestion. It must be transformed and flattened first.
    3.  **Use `MERGE` for Idempotency:** This is the standard pattern to avoid creating duplicate data.
    4.  **Batch Everything:** All data should be loaded in batches using `UNWIND` or APOC procedures to maximize performance and ensure transactional integrity.
    5.  **Leverage APOC:** The APOC library is not just an add-on; it is considered a core part of any serious Neo4j ingestion pipeline.

## 4. The "Language-Specific Considerations" Pattern

*   **Observation:** A "one-size-fits-all" approach to polyglot analysis is not practical. Each language has unique characteristics that must be accounted for.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **JavaScript:** Dynamic typing and callbacks require a model that can infer relationships without explicit declarations.
    *   **Python:** Syntactic significance of whitespace.
    *   **Java:** Strong typing and complex class hierarchies.
*   **Implication:** The Worker Agent's analysis techniques, particularly if using a fine-tuned model, will likely need to be specialized for each target language.
