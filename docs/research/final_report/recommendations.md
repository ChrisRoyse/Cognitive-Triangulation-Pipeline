# Recommendations

Based on the findings and analysis of the initial research phase, this document provides specific, actionable recommendations for the technical implementation and strategic direction of the code analysis pipeline.

## 1. High-Priority Strategic Recommendations

*   **Acknowledge and Address the "Accuracy vs. AI" Paradox:** The project's leadership must acknowledge that the core technical challenge is not parsing, but verification. The primary strategic focus should be on designing and building a robust system for validating and correcting the output of the AI models.
*   **Commit Fully to a Fine-Tuning Strategy:** The project must allocate the necessary time, resources, and personnel for a comprehensive fine-tuning effort. This includes building a data annotation pipeline and acquiring the necessary MLOps expertise. This should be considered a core development task, not a secondary research effort.
*   **Adopt a Phased, Single-Language Rollout:** The complexity of the project should be managed by tackling one language at a time. The recommended order is:
    1.  **Python:** Its clear syntax makes it a good candidate for developing the initial end-to-end pipeline.
    2.  **JavaScript:** Its dynamic nature will present a greater challenge and will be a good test of the system's capabilities.
    3.  **Java:** Its strong typing and complex object-oriented features will require the most sophisticated analysis.

## 2. Architectural Recommendations

*   **Implement a Multi-Pass Pipeline:** The system's architecture must be designed to handle multi-pass analysis to correctly resolve inter-file dependencies. The recommended architecture is:
    1.  **Scout Pass:** Identifies all relevant source files.
    2.  **Worker Analysis Pass:** Analyzes all files in parallel to extract entities and *potential* relationships.
    3.  **Global Resolution Pass:** Resolves all inter-file and inter-language relationships.
    4.  **Ingestion Pass:** Loads the final, verified data into Neo4j.
*   **Design for a Pluggable, Language-Specific Worker:** The Worker Agent should be designed to be modular. It should be able to dynamically load the appropriate fine-tuned model and language-specific validation rules based on the file it is analyzing.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps and Tactical Recommendations

*   **Initiate a Targeted Research Cycle on Verification:** The immediate next step is to launch a new, targeted research cycle focused on the most critical knowledge gap: **How to verify the output of an LLM for code analysis.** This research should explore multi-agent critic systems, GNN-based validation, and other state-of-the-art techniques.
*   **Begin Building the Data Annotation Pipeline:** Work should begin immediately on the tools and processes for creating the annotated dataset that will be required for fine-tuning. This includes developing the initial prompts for a general-purpose LLM to create the "draft" annotations and designing the human-in-the-loop review interface.
*   **Prototype the Ingestion Agent:** The Ingestion Agent is the most well-understood component of the system. A prototype can be built in parallel with the further research on the Worker Agent. This prototype should focus on implementing the batched, idempotent ingestion patterns using the APOC library.
