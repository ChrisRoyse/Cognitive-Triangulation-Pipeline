# Recommendations

Based on the findings of the deep research, this document provides a set of actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of the "Cognitive Triangulation" code analysis pipeline.

## 1. For the `EntityScout` Agent

*   **Recommendation 1.1**: Implement `EntityScout` using a smaller, faster LLM (e.g., a distilled model or a model like GPT-3.5-Turbo). The primary goal is speed of scanning, not perfect accuracy.
*   **Recommendation 1.2**: The prompts for `EntityScout` should be highly structured and use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) principles to guide the extraction of different entity types.
*   **Recommendation 1.3**: `EntityScout` must be prompted to return its findings in a standardized JSON format (a "POI report"). This schema should be strictly enforced.
*   **Recommendation 1.4**: A library of few-shot examples should be created for each programming language to be supported. These examples will be dynamically included in the prompts to improve accuracy.
*   **Recommendation 1.5**: Implement a file chunking mechanism to handle large files that exceed the context window of the chosen LLM.

## 2. For the `RelationshipResolver` Agent

*   **Recommendation 2.1**: Implement `RelationshipResolver` using a powerful, state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus). The primary goal is accuracy of analysis.
*   **Recommendation 2.2**: The core of the `RelationshipResolver` should be a hybrid system that uses vector embeddings for candidate generation and a powerful LLM for validation.
    *   *Step 1*: Generate vector embeddings for all POIs from the `EntityScout` reports.
    *   *Step 2*: Use vector similarity search to identify a list of potential relationships.
    *   *Step 3*: For each potential relationship, send the relevant POIs to the powerful LLM for validation.
*   **Recommendation 2.3**: Implement a "Cognitive Triangulation" strategy for validation. A combination of Multi-Model Consensus and LLM-as-Judge is recommended as the primary strategy. Metamorphic testing should be considered for a subset of findings as a further validation step.
*   **Recommendation 2.4**: The `RelationshipResolver` must output a confidence score for each validated relationship, derived from the level of agreement in the triangulation process.

## 3. For the `GraphBuilder` Agent

*   **Recommendation 3.1**: The `GraphBuilder` should be designed to be a simple, robust agent that consumes the validated graph data from the `RelationshipResolver`. Its primary responsibility is to interact with the Neo4j database.
*   **Recommendation 3.2**: The process of populating the database must be idempotent. The agent should check for the existence of nodes and relationships before creating them to avoid duplicates.
*   **Recommendation 3.3**: The `GraphBuilder` should have configurable rules for how to handle relationships with different confidence scores (e.g., it may only ingest relationships with a "high" confidence score).

## 4. For the Overall Pipeline

*   **Recommendation 4.1**: A continuous evaluation framework should be established to measure the accuracy and performance of the pipeline over time. This should include a "ground truth" dataset of code with known entities and relationships.
*   **Recommendation 4.2**: The next phase of research should focus on addressing the knowledge gaps identified in the `knowledge_gaps.md` document. This will be crucial for refining the design and ensuring the long-term success of the project.
