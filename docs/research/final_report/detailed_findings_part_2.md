# Detailed Findings, Part 2: Relationship Analysis and Triangulation

This section details the research findings related to the `RelationshipResolver` agent, focusing on cross-file relationship analysis and the "Cognitive Triangulation" strategies used to ensure accuracy.

## 1. Context Management for Relationship Analysis

The core challenge for the `RelationshipResolver` is the context window limit of LLMs. The research points to a hybrid approach as the most effective solution.

*   **Vector Embeddings for Candidate Generation**:
    *   **Finding**: The most efficient way to identify potential relationships across a large codebase is to use vector embeddings. Each POI identified by `EntityScout` should be converted into a vector representation. A similarity search can then be performed to find pairs of POIs that are semantically related (e.g., a function call and a function definition).
    *   **Implication**: This creates a highly efficient "first pass" that dramatically narrows down the search space for the more powerful, but slower, LLM.

*   **LLM for Validation**:
    *   **Finding**: Once a candidate relationship has been identified, the relevant POIs (and potentially summaries of their containing files) should be passed to a powerful LLM for validation.
    *   **Implication**: This allows the powerful LLM to focus its analytical capabilities on a small, highly relevant slice of context, which is a much more effective use of its abilities.

## 2. "Cognitive Triangulation" Strategies

This is the core of the `RelationshipResolver`'s validation process. The research indicates that a combination of the following techniques will be most effective.

*   **Multi-Model Consensus**:
    *   **Finding**: Different LLMs have different strengths and weaknesses. By sending the same validation task to multiple models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini) and comparing the results, we can significantly increase the confidence in the final answer.
    *   **Implication**: The `RelationshipResolver` should be designed to work with multiple LLM APIs.

*   **LLM-as-Judge**:
    *   **Finding**: This technique involves using one LLM to critique the output of another. In cases of disagreement between models in the multi-model consensus, a "judge" LLM can be used to make a final decision.
    *   **Implication**: This provides a clear mechanism for resolving conflicts and arriving at a final, validated answer.

*   **Metamorphic Testing**:
    *   **Finding**: This technique, which involves programmatically altering the input to see if the output changes in an expected way, is a powerful tool for validating the LLM's understanding of code.
    *   **Implication**: For a subset of high-confidence relationships, the `RelationshipResolver` could perform a metamorphic test as a final "sanity check." For example, it could rename a variable in a function call and see if the LLM correctly identifies the same relationship with the new variable name.

## 3. Confidence Scoring

The output of the `RelationshipResolver` should not be a simple binary "yes" or "no." It should include a confidence score.

*   **Finding**: The confidence score can be directly derived from the triangulation process.
    *   **High Confidence**: All models in the multi-model consensus agree.
    *   **Medium Confidence**: There is a majority agreement, and the "judge" LLM confirms the majority opinion.
    *   **Low Confidence**: There is significant disagreement among the models.
*   **Implication**: This confidence score will be crucial for the `GraphBuilder`, which may have different rules for how to handle relationships with different levels of confidence.
