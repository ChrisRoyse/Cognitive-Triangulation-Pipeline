# Methodology

This document outlines the methodology used to conduct the deep research for the "Cognitive Triangulation" code analysis pipeline. The research was structured to be systematic, recursive, and to provide a strong foundation for the creation of function-level specifications.

## 1. Research Framework

The research process followed a structured, multi-stage framework:

1.  **Initialization and Scoping**: This initial phase focused on clearly defining the boundaries and objectives of the research.
    *   A `scope_definition.md` document was created to outline the project goals and the specific architectural components in scope.
    *   A `key_questions.md` document was drafted to establish the central questions that would drive the investigation.
    *   A `information_sources.md` document was created to identify the types of content and the primary search tools to be used.

2.  **Initial Data Collection**: This phase involved broad-based research to gather a wide range of information on the key topics.
    *   The primary tool used was a general AI search engine, accessed via the `github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp` MCP tool.
    *   A series of broad queries were formulated based on the key questions.
    *   The findings were documented in a series of `primary_findings_part_N.md` files, with each file focusing on a specific research topic.

3.  **First-Pass Analysis and Gap Identification**: This phase focused on analyzing the initial findings to identify high-level patterns and, crucially, to identify areas where more research was needed.
    *   The key patterns and recurring strategies were synthesized into an `identified_patterns.md` document.
    *   A `knowledge_gaps.md` document was created to explicitly list the unanswered questions and potential contradictions that emerged from the research. This document is intended to drive the next, more targeted research cycle.

4.  **Targeted Research Cycles (Future Work)**: This phase, which is a future step, will involve conducting deep-dive research into the specific questions identified in the `knowledge_gaps.md` document.

5.  **Synthesis and Final Report Generation**: This final phase involved synthesizing all the findings from the initial research into a cohesive final report.
    *   An `executive_summary.md` was created to provide a high-level overview of the research and its key findings.
    *   This `methodology.md` document was created to ensure the research process is transparent and repeatable.
    *   The other components of the final report (e.g., `detailed_findings.md`, `recommendations.md`) were populated based on the documents created in the earlier phases.

## 2. Core Principles

The research was guided by the following core principles:

*   **Structured and Systematic**: The research was conducted in a structured manner, with clear phases and deliverables for each phase.
*   **Recursive**: The process is designed to be recursive. The knowledge gaps identified in one phase become the research questions for the next phase.
*   **Traceable**: All findings are documented and linked back to the key questions and information sources, ensuring that the entire research process is traceable.
*   **Action-Oriented**: The ultimate goal of the research is to provide actionable insights that can directly inform the design and implementation of the "Cognitive Triangulation" pipeline.
