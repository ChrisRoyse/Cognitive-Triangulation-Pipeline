# Primary Findings, Part 3: Stream Processing Frameworks - Flink vs. Spark Streaming

This document evaluates high-level stream processing frameworks that can operate on data streams from a message broker like Apache Kafka. The primary candidates considered are Apache Flink and Spark Streaming, assessed for their suitability in a low-latency, stateful code analysis pipeline.

## 1. Core Processing Models: The Fundamental Difference

**Apache Flink: True Stream Processing**
*   Flink processes data on an event-by-event basis as it arrives. This is a "true" or "native" streaming model.
*   Its architecture is designed from the ground up for continuous, unbounded data streams, which allows for millisecond-level processing latency.
*   Batch processing is treated as a special, finite case of streaming.

**Spark Streaming: Micro-Batch Processing**
*   Spark Streaming operates on a micro-batching model. It collects data from the source stream into small, discrete batches (e.g., every 1-2 seconds) and then processes each batch.
*   While its newer "Structured Streaming" API provides a continuous-feeling developer experience, the underlying engine is still executing a series of small, fast batch jobs.
*   This architectural choice inherently introduces higher latency compared to a true streaming model.

## 2. State Management Capabilities

The code analysis pipeline may require stateful operations (e.g., tracking dependencies across multiple files in a commit).

*   **Flink:** Provides first-class support for stateful stream processing. It has robust mechanisms for maintaining state (e.g., keyed state for individual entities) across events and over long periods. Its checkpointing is highly efficient and asynchronous.
*   **Spark Streaming:** Also supports stateful processing, but its state management is built on top of the micro-batch model. This can be less efficient for operations requiring frequent, low-latency state updates.

## 3. Latency and Performance

*   **Flink:** Is the clear winner for low-latency applications, consistently achieving millisecond-level processing times.
*   **Spark Streaming:** Latency is fundamentally tied to the batch interval, making it more suitable for "near-real-time" applications where a few seconds of delay is acceptable.

## 4. Windowing and Event Time

Both frameworks support windowing (e.g., tumbling, sliding, session windows) and event-time processing (as opposed to processing time).

*   **Flink:** Is often considered to have more flexible and powerful windowing capabilities, with native support for handling late-arriving data through its watermark mechanism.
*   **Spark Streaming:** Also has robust windowing, but its implementation is tied to the micro-batch execution, which can make some complex scenarios (like custom session windows) more challenging to implement with low latency.

## 5. Conclusion: Flink for a Low-Latency Pipeline

For the requirements of the code analysis pipeline, **Apache Flink is the superior choice.**

*   Its **true streaming architecture** is a natural fit for processing a continuous flow of file analysis events from Kafka with minimal delay.
*   Its **advanced state management** provides the foundation needed for any future complex, stateful analysis (e.g., cross-file dependency tracking).
*   Its **low-latency performance** ensures the pipeline can keep up with a high volume of incoming data without becoming a bottleneck.

While Spark Streaming is a powerful and popular framework, its micro-batching model introduces a latency floor that is undesirable for this particular real-time processing use case. The selection of Flink aligns with the architectural goals of building a highly responsive and scalable system.
