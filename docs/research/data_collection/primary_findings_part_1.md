# Primary Findings, Part 1: Message Queues vs. Streaming Platforms

This document captures the initial findings in the investigation of a new architecture for the code analysis pipeline, focusing on the fundamental choice between a traditional message broker and an event streaming platform. The primary candidates evaluated are RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka, respectively.

## 1. Core Architectural Differences

**Apache Kafka:**
*   **Architecture:** Kafka is fundamentally a distributed, append-only commit log. Data is written to topics, which are split into partitions and replicated across a cluster of brokers. This log-based architecture is optimized for high-throughput sequential disk I/O.
*   **Data Model:** It treats data as a continuous stream of events. Messages are immutable and retained for a configurable period, even after being read by consumers.
*   **Primary Use Case:** Designed for real-time event streaming, large-scale data ingestion, and building data pipelines that require replayable reads and durable storage.

**RabbitMQ:**
*   **Architecture:** RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It uses a flexible system of exchanges, queues, and bindings to route messages.
*   **Data Model:** It treats data as discrete messages to be delivered to one or more consumers. Once a message is successfully processed, it is typically removed from the queue.
*   **Primary Use Case:** Designed for background job processing, task distribution, and complex routing scenarios in enterprise messaging systems.

| Feature               | Apache Kafka                                                                                             | RabbitMQ                                                                                                 | Relevance to Pipeline Failure                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Throughput**        | Extremely high; capable of handling millions of messages per second.                                     | High, but typically lower than Kafka. Can be a bottleneck under heavy load without significant clustering. | The previous system failed under load. Kafka's architecture is better suited for the massive influx of file discovery events. |
| **Data Retention**    | Excellent; messages are retained by default, allowing for replayability and multiple consumer use cases.   | Limited; messages are ephemeral by default. Newer features like Streams add retention but are less mature. | Replayability is crucial for reprocessing failed batches or for new analysis without re-scanning the entire codebase.         |
| **Consumer Model**    | Pull-based. Consumers read from partitions at their own pace. Consumer groups allow for easy scaling.     | Push-based. The broker pushes messages to consumers. Can be more complex to scale with guaranteed ordering. | Kafka's consumer group model provides a more natural and scalable way to distribute file analysis tasks among `WorkerAgents`. |
| **Back-Pressure**     | Handled naturally by the pull-based consumer model. Consumers will not request more data than they can handle. | Requires careful implementation. Unchecked producers can overwhelm the broker and consumers.                   | The lack of back-pressure was a key failure point. Kafka provides an inherent mechanism to prevent this.                    |
| **Scalability**       | Scales horizontally with ease by adding more brokers and partitions.                                       | Can be clustered, but scaling is generally considered more complex than Kafka.                           | The new architecture must be able to scale horizontally to meet demand.                                                     |

## 3. Initial Conclusion

Based on this initial research, **Apache Kafka appears to be the more suitable foundation for the new architecture.** Its core design as a high-throughput, scalable, and durable streaming platform directly addresses the primary failures of the previous system:

1.  It replaces the inadequate SQLite-based queue with a system designed for this purpose.
2.  Its data retention and replayability features provide resilience.
3.  Its consumer model provides a natural mechanism for back-pressure and scalable processing.

RabbitMQ is a powerful tool, but its strengths in complex routing and transient messaging are less relevant to the core problem of processing a massive, continuous stream of file data.
