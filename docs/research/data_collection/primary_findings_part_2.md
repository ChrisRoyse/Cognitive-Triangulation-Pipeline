# Primary Findings, Part 2: Cross-file Relationship Analysis

This document summarizes the initial findings on methods for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform cross-file code relationship analysis, which is the core responsibility of the `RelationshipResolver` agent. The primary challenge is the limited context window of LLMs when dealing with large codebases.

## 1. Context Management Techniques

To analyze relationships across an entire codebase, the context presented to the LLM must be managed effectively. The following techniques are prominent:

*   **Context Chunking**: This is the most straightforward approach. Large codebases are broken down into smaller, manageable chunks that can fit within an LLM's context window.
    *   **Method**: Files can be chunked individually, or more sophisticated methods can be used to group related files or functions together.
    *   **Relevance**: For the `RelationshipResolver`, this means it won't look at the entire codebase at once. Instead, it will likely process a curated set of POI reports that are contextually relevant to the relationship being investigated.

*   **Summarization**: LLMs can be used to generate abstract summaries of code files or functions. These summaries capture the essential semantics and purpose of the code without including every line.
    *   **Method**: An initial LLM pass generates a high-level summary of each file or major component.
    *   **Relevance**: The `RelationshipResolver` could work with summaries of POIs rather than the raw code of the POIs themselves. This would allow it to have a much broader, albeit less detailed, view of the codebase in a single pass.

## 2. Graph-Based Relationship Detection

Graph structures are a powerful way to represent code and overcome context limitations. They explicitly model the relationships that need to be discovered.

*   **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)**: While the project rules forbid using AST *parsers*, the *concept* of a tree-like structure is still relevant. LLMs can be prompted to generate a simplified, JSON-based representation of code structure that is similar to an AST.
    *   **Relevance**: This suggests that the POI reports from `EntityScout` should contain hierarchical information (e.g., a method belonging to a class).

*   **Vector Embeddings**: Code snippets can be converted into numerical vector representations using models like `CodeBERT` or `UniXcoder`. In this vector space, code with similar semantics will be closer together.
    *   **Method**: The `RelationshipResolver` can compare the embeddings of different POIs to find likely relationships. For example, the embedding for a function call should be very similar to the embedding of the called function's definition.
    *   **Relevance**: This is a very promising technique for the `RelationshipResolver`. It could be used to generate a list of candidate relationships that are then validated by a more powerful LLM.

*   **Explicit Graph Architectures (e.g., `CODEXGRAPH`)**: This is the most advanced approach. It involves using a combination of LLMs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build a comprehensive graph of the entire codebase.
    *   **Method**: Nodes in the graph represent code entities (functions, classes), and edges represent relationships (calls, inheritance).
    *   **Relevance**: This directly aligns with the project's goal of populating a Neo4j database. The `RelationshipResolver`'s main task can be seen as generating the data needed to construct this kind of graph.

## 3. Implementation and Evaluation

*   **Benchmarks**: The existence of benchmarks like `CrossCodeEval` for cross-file code completion indicates that this is an active area of research. These benchmarks can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the `RelationshipResolver`.
*   **Hybrid Approaches**: The most effective solutions will likely combine these techniques. For example, chunking can be used to retrieve a relevant subgraph of the codebase, which is then analyzed by an LLM to resolve a specific dependency.

## 4. Initial Workflow for `RelationshipResolver`

Based on these findings, a possible workflow for the `RelationshipResolver` emerges:

1.  **Receive POI Reports**: Ingest all POI reports from `EntityScout`.
2.  **Generate Embeddings**: Create a vector embedding for each POI.
3.  **Candidate Generation**: Use embedding similarity to identify a list of potential relationships between POIs.
4.  **LLM Validation**: For each candidate relationship, present the relevant POIs (and potentially their code summaries) to a powerful LLM and ask it to confirm or deny the relationship. This is a key part of the "Cognitive Triangulation."
5.  **Output Validated Graph**: The output is a list of validated entities and relationships, ready for the `GraphBuilder`.
