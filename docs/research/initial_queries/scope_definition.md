# Research Scope Definition

This research will focus on identifying, evaluating, and recommending a scalable, resilient, and streaming-based architecture for a high-performance code analysis pipeline. The scope is driven by the critical failures identified in the post-mortem report, specifically addressing the challenges of memory-intensiveness, inadequate queuing, and lack of data flow control.

The primary areas of investigation are:

1.  **Streaming Data Ingestion and Processing:**
    *   Techniques for processing large files without loading them entirely into memory.
    *   Evaluation of Node.js stream capabilities for I/O operations.
    *   Strategies for handling data chunks and streaming them to external APIs (e.g., LLMs).

2.  **Dedicated Message Brokers vs. Streaming Platforms:**
    *   In-depth comparison of message queues like **Apache Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**.
    *   Analysis of cloud-native solutions such as **AWS SQS** and **Google Pub/Sub**.
    *   Evaluation of integrated streaming platforms like **Apache Flink** and **Apache Spark Streaming** for more complex processing needs.
    *   Key criteria will include durability, ordering guarantees, throughput, latency, scalability, and operational complexity.

3.  **Back-Pressure and Flow Control:**
    *   Investigation of built-in back-pressure mechanisms within stream processing frameworks.
    *   Architectural patterns for implementing back-pressure in systems using message brokers to ensure stability under variable load.

4.  **Resilient Data Handling and Error Management:**
    *   Best practices for data schema validation (e.g., using Avro, Protobuf) across distributed components.
    *   Designing robust error-handling pathways, including the use of Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for failed message processing.
    *   Strategies for idempotent data ingestion into the graph database to prevent data duplication during retries.

5.  **Architectural Patterns:**
    *   Analysis of the **Pipes and Filters** pattern for creating a decoupled and maintainable pipeline.
    *   Exploration of **Event Sourcing** or **Change Data Capture (CDC)** as potential patterns for ensuring data consistency and auditability.

The final output will be a set of actionable recommendations for a new architecture that directly remedies the flaws of the previous system and provides a solid foundation for future scalability.
