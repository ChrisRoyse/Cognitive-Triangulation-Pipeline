# Potential Information Sources

This document lists the potential sources of information that will be consulted during the research process.

## 1. Primary Information Source

*   **General AI Search (via MCP Tool):** A general-purpose AI search tool will be the primary resource for this research. It will be used to query academic papers, technical blogs, conference proceedings, and official documentation related to AI, code analysis, and graph databases.

## 2. Academic and Research Databases

*   **arXiv:** For pre-print articles on the latest research in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning on code, and graph neural networks.
*   **Google Scholar:** To find peer-reviewed papers and articles from a wide range of academic publishers.
*   **ACM Digital Library & IEEE Xplore:** For high-quality research papers from leading computer science conferences and journals.

## 3. Technical Blogs and Industry Publications

*   **AI and ML Publications:** Blogs from companies like Google AI, Meta AI, OpenAI, and Hugging Face.
*   **Data Engineering Blogs:** Publications from companies like Neo4j, Databricks, and Confluent for insights into data ingestion and graph modeling.
*   **Medium and Towards Data Science:** For articles and tutorials from individual researchers and practitioners.

## 4. Open Source Projects and Documentation

*   **Source Code of Analysis Tools:** Examining the source code of existing code analysis and intelligence platforms (e.g., Sourcegraph, CodeQL, Semantic) to understand their approaches, even if they use traditional methods, can provide valuable context.
*   **LLM and NLP Library Documentation:** Documentation for libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, and others will be consulted for implementation details.
*   **Neo4j Documentation:** The official Neo4j documentation will be the definitive source for schema design, Cypher query optimization, and data import best practices.
