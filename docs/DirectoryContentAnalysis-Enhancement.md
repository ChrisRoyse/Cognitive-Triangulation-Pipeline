# Directory Content Analysis Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the DirectoryResolutionWorker to use smart content extraction instead of simple 500-character truncation, providing better context for directory understanding.

## Problem
The previous implementation truncated file content to only 500 characters, which:
- Missed important function definitions beyond 500 chars
- Couldn't understand file structure properly
- Lost critical imports/exports at end of files
- Made directory purpose analysis incomplete

## Solution
Implemented a smart content extraction approach that:
1. **Extracts key sections** from each file:
   - File headers/documentation
   - Import statements (dependencies)
   - Main class/function definitions with constructors
   - Export statements

2. **Handles multiple programming languages**:
   - JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Python
   - Java, C/C++, C#
   - Go, Rust, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, and more

3. **Intelligently limits content**:
   - Files under 2000 chars are included in full
   - Larger files have key sections extracted
   - Total content limited to ~3000 chars per file
   - Prioritizes imports → definitions → exports

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes in `directoryResolutionWorker.js`

1. **New `extractKeyContent` method**:
   - Filters by code file extensions
   - Extracts documentation headers
   - Collects import/require statements
   - Captures class/function definitions with context
   - Preserves module exports

2. **Enhanced definition extraction**:
   - Uses bracket counting to capture complete definitions
   - Includes constructors and initial methods
   - Limits to 5 lines per definition to balance detail vs size

3. **Smart prioritization**:
   - When content exceeds limits, prioritizes:
     1. Imports (for dependencies)
     2. Key definitions (for functionality)
     3. Exports (for API surface)

## Benefits

1. **Better Context**: LLM receives comprehensive file information instead of arbitrary truncation
2. **Dependency Understanding**: All imports are captured for understanding file relationships
3. **API Surface Clarity**: Export statements show what each file provides
4. **Language Agnostic**: Works across multiple programming languages
5. **Efficient Token Usage**: Smart selection stays within LLM token limits

## Example Comparison

### Before (500 char truncation):
```
/**
 * UserService - Handles all user-related operations
 * This service manages user authentication, profile updates,
 * and integration with external OAuth providers.
 */

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { OAuth2Client } = require('google-auth-library');
const { UserModel } = require('../models/User');
const { EmailService } = require('./EmailService');
const { CacheService } = require('./CacheService');
const { Logger } = require('../utils/Logger'
[... TRUNCATED ...]
```

### After (Smart extraction):
```
// File header/documentation:
/**
 * UserService - Handles all user-related operations
 * This service manages user authentication, profile updates,
 * and integration with external OAuth providers.
 */

// Imports/Dependencies:
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { OAuth2Client } = require('google-auth-library');
const { UserModel } = require('../models/User');
const { EmailService } = require('./EmailService');
const { CacheService } = require('./CacheService');
const { Logger } = require('../utils/Logger');

// Key definitions:
class UserService {
    constructor(dbConnection, config) {
        this.db = dbConnection;
        this.config = config;
        this.emailService = new EmailService(config.email);
        this.cache = new CacheService(config.redis);
        this.logger = new Logger('UserService');

// Exports:
module.exports = { UserService };
```

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/workers/directoryResolutionWorker.test.js`
- Added integration tests in `tests/integration/directoryContentAnalysis.test.js`
- All tests passing with improved content extraction

## Impact
This enhancement significantly improves the accuracy of directory analysis by providing the LLM with complete context about file purposes, dependencies, and relationships within a directory.
