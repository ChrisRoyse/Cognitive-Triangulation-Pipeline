# Pseudocode: ConfidenceScoringService (Version 2 - Revised for Clarity)

## Overview
The `ConfidenceScoringService` calculates a final confidence score for a piece of analysis by aggregating multiple pieces of evidence. It establishes a baseline score from the first piece of evidence and then modifies this score based on all subsequent evidence provided.

## Dependencies
- None

## TDD Anchors
- TEST: `calculateFinalScore` with an empty or null `evidenceArray` returns a default low score (e.g., 0).
- TEST: `calculateFinalScore` with a single piece of evidence returns its initial score after applying its own boosts/penalties and clamping to the valid range.
- TEST: `calculateFinalScore` with multiple pieces of evidence correctly uses the first as a baseline and iterates from the second for `initialScore` adjustments.
- TEST: `calculateFinalScore` correctly aggregates boosts and penalties from all evidence items.
- TEST: `calculateFinalScore` correctly clamps the final score between a defined MIN (0) and MAX (100).

## Function: `calculateFinalScore`

### Description
Calculates a final, aggregated confidence score from an array of evidence objects. The logic is made explicit to enhance clarity--
1.  The `initialScore` of the first evidence item sets the `finalScore`.
2.  A single loop then processes all items to apply adjustments.
3.  For all subsequent items (from the second onwards), their `initialScore` is added as a major adjustment.
4.  Boosts and penalties from *every* item are applied.
5.  The final result is clamped to a [0, 100] range.

### INPUT
- `evidenceArray`-- An array of `Evidence` objects. Each object contains--
  - `initialScore`-- A numerical score (e.g., 0-100).
  - `boosts`-- An array of numerical values for positive adjustments.
  - `penalties`-- An array of numerical values for negative adjustments.

### OUTPUT
- A single numerical value representing the final confidence score, clamped between 0 and 100.

### Logic

1.  **CONSTANT** `MAX_SCORE` = 100
2.  **CONSTANT** `MIN_SCORE` = 0

3.  **FUNCTION** `calculateFinalScore`(`evidenceArray`)
4.      -- TEST-- Handle empty or invalid input array
5.      **IF** `evidenceArray` is null OR `evidenceArray` is empty **THEN**
6.          **RETURN** `MIN_SCORE`
7.      **END IF**

8.      -- Step 1-- Explicitly initialize the score using the first piece of evidence.
9.      -- This clarifies that the first item's score is the baseline.
10.     Let `finalScore` = `evidenceArray`[0].`initialScore`

11.     -- Step 2-- Iterate through the entire evidence array to apply all adjustments.
12.     **FOR** `i` from 0 to (length of `evidenceArray` - 1) **DO**
13.         Let `currentEvidence` = `evidenceArray`[`i`]
14.
15.         -- For items *after* the first, their initialScore acts as a major adjustment.
16.         -- TEST-- Loop correctly skips adding the initial score for the first item (i=0).
17.         **IF** `i` > 0 **THEN**
18.             `finalScore` = `finalScore` + `currentEvidence`.`initialScore`
19.         **END IF**
20.
21.         -- Apply the boosts and penalties for the current evidence item.
22.         **FOR EACH** `boost` in `currentEvidence`.`boosts` **DO**
23.             `finalScore` = `finalScore` + `boost`
24.         **END FOR**
25.
26.         **FOR EACH** `penalty` in `currentEvidence`.`penalties` **DO**
27.             `finalScore` = `finalScore` - `penalty`
28.         **END FOR**
29.     **END FOR**

30.     -- Step 3-- Clamp the final score to the defined min/max range.
31.     -- TEST-- Final score is correctly capped at MAX_SCORE
32.     `finalScore` = `min`(`finalScore`, `MAX_SCORE`)
33.
34.     -- TEST-- Final score is correctly floored at MIN_SCORE
35.     `finalScore` = `max`(`finalScore`, `MIN_SCORE`)
36.
37.     **RETURN** `finalScore`
38. **END FUNCTION**
