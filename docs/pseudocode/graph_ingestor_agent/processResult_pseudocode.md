# GraphIngestorAgent processResult() Method Pseudocode

## 1. Description

This document provides the pseudocode for the `processResult` method of the `GraphIngestorAgent`. This method orchestrates the ingestion of a single analysis result into the Neo4j graph database. It parses the result, then creates all the necessary nodes (entities) and relationships.

## 2. SPARC Framework Compliance

- **Specification**-- The `processResult` method adheres to the specifications defined in [`docs/specifications/graph_ingestor_agent_specs.md`](docs/specifications/graph_ingestor_agent_specs.md).
- **Pseudocode**-- This document.
- **Architecture**-- The architecture will be defined in the Architecture phase.
- **Refinement**-- The implementation will be refined based on this pseudocode.
- **Completion**-- The final implementation will be a result of this process.

FUNCTION processResult(result)
    -- **TDD Anchor**
    -- TEST 'should correctly parse a valid JSON result string'
    -- TEST 'should call createNode for every entity in the result'
    -- TEST 'should call createRelationship for every relationship in the result'
    -- TEST 'should handle and log errors during parsing or database operations'
    -- TEST 'should ensure the Neo4j session is always closed'
    -- TEST 'should not proceed with relationships if node creation fails'

    -- **Input**
    -- result-- An object containing the analysis result from the SQLite database.
    --          It has a 'result' property which is a JSON string.

    -- **Output**
    -- None. The method's effect is the creation of nodes and relationships in Neo4j.

    -- **Logic**
    -- 1. Initialize a Neo4j session from the driver.
    session = this.neo4jDriver.session()

    TRY
        -- 2. Parse the JSON string from the 'result' object to get the structured data.
        data = JSON.parse(result.result)

        -- 3. Validate that 'data' contains 'entities' and 'relationships' arrays.
        IF data.entities IS NOT an Array OR data.relationships IS NOT an Array THEN
            THROW new Error("Invalid result format-- missing entities or relationships array.")
        ENDIF

        -- 4. **Step 1-- Create all entity nodes.**
        --    Iterate through each entity in the 'entities' array.
        --    This ensures all nodes exist before attempting to create relationships between them.
        FOR EACH entity IN data.entities
            this.createNode(session, entity)
        ENDFOR

        -- 5. **Step 2-- Create all relationships.**
        --    Iterate through each relationship in the 'relationships' array.
        FOR EACH relationship IN data.relationships
            this.createRelationship(session, relationship)
        ENDFOR

    CATCH error
        -- 6. If an error occurs during parsing or database operations, log it.
        LOG "Error processing result ID " + result.id + "-- " + error.message
        --    Consider additional error handling, like marking the result as failed in the DB.
        --    For example-- this.db.run("UPDATE analysis_results SET processed = -1, error_message = ? WHERE id = ?", error.message, result.id)
    FINALLY
        -- 7. Ensure the Neo4j session is closed to release resources, regardless of success or failure.
        session.close()
    ENDTRY
