# GraphIngestorAgent run() Method Pseudocode

## 1. Description

This document provides the pseudocode for the `run` method of the `GraphIngestorAgent`. This method contains the main execution loop that drives the agent, continuously fetching and processing analysis results.

## 2. SPARC Framework Compliance

- **Specification**-- The `run` method adheres to the specifications defined in [`docs/specifications/graph_ingestor_agent_specs.md`](docs/specifications/graph_ingestor_agent_specs.md).
- **Pseudocode**-- This document.
- **Architecture**-- The architecture will be defined in the Architecture phase.
- **Refinement**-- The implementation will be refined based on this pseudocode.
- **Completion**-- The final implementation will be a result of this process.

```plaintext
FUNCTION run()
    -- **TDD Anchor**
    -- TEST 'run should process all available results and terminate'
    -- TEST 'run should not fail if getNextResult initially returns null'

    -- **Input**
    -- None.

    -- **Output**
    -- None. (The method completes when no more results are available).

    -- **Logic**
    -- 1. Start an infinite loop to continuously check for new results.
    LOOP true
        -- 2. Call the getNextResult() method to fetch one unprocessed analysis result.
        --    This method is responsible for atomicity.
        result = this.getNextResult()

        -- 3. Check if a result was returned.
        --    If 'result' is null or undefined, it means there are no more unprocessed results.
        IF result IS NULL THEN
            -- 4. Exit the loop.
            BREAK
        ENDIF

        -- 5. If a result was found, pass it to the processResult() method for ingestion into the graph.
        this.processResult(result)
    ENDLOOP
