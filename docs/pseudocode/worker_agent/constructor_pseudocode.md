# `WorkerAgent.constructor` Pseudocode

## 1. Description

This pseudocode outlines the logic for the `WorkerAgent` class constructor. The constructor initializes the agent with a database connection and a unique worker ID. It also sets up a mapping between supported programming languages and their corresponding parsing handler methods.

## 2. SPARC Pseudocode

```plaintext
FUNCTION constructor(db, workerId)
    -- TEST: Ensure that the 'db' property is correctly assigned.
    -- TEST: Ensure that the 'workerId' property is correctly assigned.
    -- TEST: Verify that 'languageHandlers' contains all supported languages.
    -- TEST: Verify that each language maps to the correct handler function.

    -- Inputs:
    --   db: Object -- An active database connection client.
    --   workerId: String -- A unique identifier for the worker instance.

    -- Output:
    --   An initialized instance of the WorkerAgent.

    -- Assign the database client instance to the 'db' property of the class instance.
    SET this.db TO db

    -- Assign the worker ID to the 'workerId' property.
    SET this.workerId TO workerId

    -- Create a map (dictionary or object) to hold language-specific parsing functions.
    -- This allows for easy extension and dynamic dispatch based on file language.
    SET this.languageHandlers TO {
        "JavaScript": this.parseJavaScript,
        "Python": this.parsePython,
        "Java": this.parseJava,
        "SQL": this.parseSql
    }
