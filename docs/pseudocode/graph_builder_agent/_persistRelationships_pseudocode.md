# Pseudocode for `_persistRelationships`

## 1. Method Signature
`private async FUNCTION _persistRelationships(relationships)`

## 2. Purpose
Persists a list of `Relationship` objects to the Neo4j database as edges. It uses a single, idempotent `MERGE` query to handle all relationship types and processes them in batches for efficiency and robustness.

## 3. Parameters
-   `relationships`-- `Relationship[]`-- An array of relationship objects to be created in the database. Each object is expected to have `sourcePoi`, `targetPoi`, `type`, `confidence`, and `explanation`.

## 4. Return Value
-   `Promise<void>`-- A promise that resolves when the operation is complete, or rejects if an error occurs.

## 5. TDD Anchors
-   **TEST-1--Happy-Path--** `TEST with a valid array of relationships, all relationships are created in the database.`
-   **TEST-2--Happy-Path-Idempotency--** `TEST calling the method multiple times with the same relationships does not create duplicate edges or properties.`
-   **TEST-3--Happy-Path-Batching--** `TEST with a number of relationships greater than the batch size, they are processed in multiple batches.`
-   **TEST-4--Edge-Case-Empty-Input--** `TEST with an empty or null relationships array, the method returns without error and without accessing the database.`
-   **TEST-5--Edge-Case-Multiple-Types--** `TEST with relationships of different types, all are created correctly with their respective types as a property on a generic 'RELATED_TO' edge.`
-   **TEST-6--Error-Handling--** `TEST when the database query fails for a batch, the error is logged and propagated.`
-   **TEST-7--Verification--** `TEST after successful execution, the count of relationships in the database matches the number of unique relationships provided.`

  -- This single, robust query handles all relationship types idempotently.
  -- It matches source and target POI nodes by their unique 'id' (UPID).
  -- It uses MERGE on a generic :RELATED_TO edge to avoid creating duplicates.
  -- The specific relationship 'type' and other metadata are set as properties.
  -- This approach is more efficient than creating type-specific queries.
