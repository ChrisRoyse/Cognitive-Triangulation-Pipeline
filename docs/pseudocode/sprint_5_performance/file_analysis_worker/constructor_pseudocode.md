# Pseudocode: FileAnalysisWorker.constructor()

**Module:** `src/workers/fileAnalysisWorker.js`
**Class:** `FileAnalysisWorker`
**Method:** `constructor(concurrency)`

---

## 1. Description

This constructor initializes a new instance of the `FileAnalysisWorker`. It sets up the connection to the message queue and configures the worker to process jobs concurrently. It relies on a centralized `QueueManager` to handle the actual worker creation, ensuring that standard policies for job handling (like retries and error management) are applied consistently.

---

## 2. Inputs

-   **concurrency** (Integer, Optional, Default: 4)
    -   The maximum number of jobs that this worker instance will process in parallel.

---

## 3. Outputs

-   **FileAnalysisWorker Instance**
    -   An instance of the `FileAnalysisWorker` class with the `this.worker` property initialized.

---

## 4. Properties

-   **this.worker** (Object)
    -   The underlying BullMQ worker instance responsible for pulling jobs from the queue.

## 5. Logic

```pseudocode
CLASS FileAnalysisWorker
    // Properties
    worker

    // Constructor
    FUNCTION constructor(concurrency = 4)
        // TEST-- constructor should default concurrency to 4 if not provided.
        //   - Instantiate FileAnalysisWorker without arguments.
        //   - Assert that QueueManager.createWorker was called with concurrency set to 4.

        // TEST-- constructor should accept and use a custom concurrency value.
        //   - Instantiate FileAnalysisWorker with a specific concurrency (e.g., 8).
        //   - Assert that QueueManager.createWorker was called with concurrency set to 8.

        // Define the queue name this worker will listen to.
        CONSTANT queueName = "file-analysis-queue"

        // Define the options for the worker, including concurrency.
        // The QueueManager will add other default options (e.g., connection, retry policies).
        CONSTANT workerOptions = {
            concurrency: concurrency
        }

        // The actual processing logic for each job is bound to the `processJob` method of this instance.
        // This ensures that when the worker calls the processor, `this` refers to the FileAnalysisWorker instance.
        CONSTANT processor = this.processJob.bind(this)

        // Delegate the creation of the BullMQ worker to a centralized manager.
        // This ensures all standard policies (retries, backoff, stalled job handling) are applied consistently.
        // TEST-- QueueManager.createWorker should be called with the correct queue name, processor, and options.
        //   - Spy on QueueManager.createWorker.
        //   - Instantiate FileAnalysisWorker.
        //   - Assert the spy was called with queueName, the bound processor function, and workerOptions.
        this.worker = QueueManager.createWorker(queueName, processor, workerOptions)

        LOG "FileAnalysisWorker initialized. Listening to queue '" + queueName + "' with concurrency " + concurrency + "."
    END FUNCTION

END CLASS
```

## 6. TDD Anchors

-   **`TEST constructor defaults concurrency`**: Verify that if no `concurrency` argument is provided, the `QueueManager.createWorker` function is called with a concurrency value of 4.
-   **`TEST constructor respects custom concurrency`**: Verify that when a `concurrency` argument is provided (e.g., 10), the `QueueManager.createWorker` function is called with that specific concurrency value.
-   **`TEST constructor calls QueueManager correctly`**: Verify that the constructor calls `QueueManager.createWorker` with the exact queue name (`file-analysis-queue`), a correctly bound processor function (`this.processJob`), and the constructed options object.
-   **`TEST processor function is bound correctly`**: Verify that the function passed to the `QueueManager` is correctly bound to the `FileAnalysisWorker` instance, so that `this` context is maintained during job processing.
