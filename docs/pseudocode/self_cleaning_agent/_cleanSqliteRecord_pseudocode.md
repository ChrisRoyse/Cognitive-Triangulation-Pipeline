# Pseudocode for `SelfCleaningAgent._cleanSqliteRecord`

## Description

This document outlines the pseudocode for the `_cleanSqliteRecord` method. This method is responsible for removing the database record corresponding to a specific file path from the SQLite `files` table. This is a crucial cleanup step to ensure the database state is synchronized with the file system.

## SPARC Framework Adherence

-   **Specification:** The pseudocode directly implements the logic defined in the `SelfCleaningAgent_specs.md` for deleting a file record.
-   **Pseudocode:** The logic is presented in a language-agnostic format, focusing on clarity and the sequence of operations.
-   **Architecture:** This method is a low-level database interaction component within the `SelfCleaningAgent`, supporting its primary function of system cleanup.
-   **Refinement & Completion:** TDD anchors are included to guide the creation of unit tests, ensuring the method's reliability and correctness.

## Method-- `_cleanSqliteRecord(filePath)`

### **Purpose**

Deletes a file record from the SQLite `files` table based on its path.

### **Parameters**

-   `filePath` (String) -- The absolute or relative path of the file to be removed from the database.

### **Returns**

-   `Promise<void>` -- A promise that resolves when the database operation is complete or rejects if an error occurs.

### **TDD Anchors**

-   **TEST_HAPPY_PATH** -- Verify that when given a valid `filePath` that exists in the `files` table, the corresponding record is successfully deleted.
-   **TEST_RECORD_NOT_FOUND** -- Verify that the method completes without error even if the `filePath` does not exist in the `files` table. The database state should remain unchanged.
-   **TEST_DB_ERROR** -- Verify that if the database operation fails (e.g., due to a connection issue or syntax error), the promise is rejected and the error is propagated.
-   **TEST_INPUT_VALIDATION** -- Verify that the method handles invalid input, such as a null or empty `filePath`, by logging an error and returning without attempting a database operation.

### **Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION _cleanSqliteRecord(filePath)
    -- TEST_INPUT_VALIDATION -- Anchor for testing invalid filePath input
    IF filePath IS NULL OR EMPTY
        LOG "Error-- filePath cannot be null or empty."
        RETURN // Or throw an error, depending on desired strictness
    END IF

    // The database instance is assumed to be available to the class, e.g., this.sqliteDb
    CONSTANT db = GET_SQLITE_DATABASE_INSTANCE()

    // Define the SQL query to delete a record from the 'files' table
    CONSTANT query = "DELETE FROM files WHERE file_path = ?;"

    TRY
        // Execute the delete operation. The 'run' method is asynchronous.
        // It takes the query and an array of parameters.
        AWAIT db.run(query, [filePath])

        // TEST_HAPPY_PATH -- Anchor to check if the record was deleted
        // TEST_RECORD_NOT_FOUND -- Anchor to check behavior when record doesn't exist
        LOG "Successfully executed delete command for filePath-- " + filePath

    CATCH error
        // TEST_DB_ERROR -- Anchor for verifying database error handling
        LOG "Error deleting record for filePath '" + filePath + "' from SQLite-- " + error.message
        // Re-throw the error to allow the caller to handle it
        THROW error
    END TRY
