# SelfCleaningAgent `_cleanSqliteBatch` Method Pseudocode

## FUNCTION _cleanSqliteBatch(filePaths)

### Description
This helper function performs a batch deletion of file records from the SQLite database. It accepts a list of file paths and deletes all corresponding records from the `files` table within a single atomic transaction. This guarantees that either all specified records are removed or none are, maintaining database consistency.

### TDD Anchors
-   TEST should not perform any action if the `filePaths` array is null or empty.
-   TEST should begin a transaction with the SQLite database.
-   TEST should prepare a single `DELETE` statement with a `WHERE IN` clause.
-   TEST should execute the prepared statement with the `filePaths` array.
-   TEST should commit the transaction if the execution is successful.
-   TEST should roll back the transaction if the execution fails.
-   TEST should throw a specific error if the database operation fails.
-   TEST should log the successful deletion of records.
-   TEST should log the error and rollback on failure.

### Logic
```pseudocode
FUNCTION _cleanSqliteBatch(filePaths)
  INPUT: filePaths -- An array of strings, where each string is a file path.
  OUTPUT: None -- Throws an error on failure.

  -- TEST--_cleanSqliteBatch handles empty or null input gracefully
  IF filePaths IS NULL OR filePaths IS EMPTY
    LOG "No file paths provided for SQLite batch cleanup. Skipping."
    RETURN
  END IF

  TRY
    -- TEST--_cleanSqliteBatch begins a database transaction
    db.beginTransaction()

    -- Create a list of placeholders for the IN clause, e.g., (?, ?, ?)
    placeholders = filePaths.map(() => "?").join(", ")
    
    -- Prepare a single DELETE statement to remove all matching records
    -- TEST--_cleanSqliteBatch prepares a single batch DELETE statement
    sqlQuery = `DELETE FROM files WHERE file_path IN (${placeholders})`
    
    -- Execute the query with the array of file paths as parameters
    db.run(sqlQuery, filePaths)

    -- TEST--_cleanSqliteBatch commits the transaction on success
    db.commit()
    LOG `Successfully deleted SQLite records for ${filePaths.length} files.`

  CATCH error
    -- TEST--_cleanSqliteBatch rolls back the transaction on failure
    db.rollback()
    LOG_ERROR `Failed to clean SQLite batch. Transaction rolled back. Reason: ${error.message}`
    -- TEST--_cleanSqliteBatch throws an error on failure
    THROW new Error("SQLite batch deletion failed.")
  END TRY
