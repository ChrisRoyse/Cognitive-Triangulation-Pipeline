## Implementation Guide

### 1. Replace Existing Validation

```javascript
// Before (in GraphBuilder_optimized.js)
const validationResult = await this.validateDataIntegrity();

// After (optimized)
const OptimizedDataValidator = require('../utils/OptimizedDataValidator');
const validator = new OptimizedDataValidator(this.db, {
    cacheSize: 10000,
    enableStreaming: true,
    batchSize: 5000
});
const validationResult = await validator.validateDataIntegrity();
```

### 2. Configure Performance Settings

```javascript
// src/config/performanceConfig.js
module.exports = {
    validation: {
        cacheSize: 10000,
        cacheTtlMs: 300000, // 5 minutes
        batchSize: 5000,
        enableParallelValidation: true,
        maxValidationTimeMs: 1000
    }
};
```

### 3. Enable Monitoring

```javascript
const perfMetrics = validator.getPerformanceMetrics();
console.log('Cache hit rate:', perfMetrics.cacheStats.hitRate);
console.log('Validation time:', perfMetrics.validationTime);
```
