    // AI-Verifiable Completion Criterion--
    // 1. Only new/modified files are added to `work_queue`.
    // 2. Deletions/renames are correctly added to `refactoring_tasks`.
    // 3. All SQLite tasks are processed to completion.
    // 4. The final Neo4j graph is identical to the "golden" graph for the *updated* state of the repository.

    // Given a repository has already been processed once, establishing a baseline state
    // And the corresponding scout_state.json, SQLite DB, and Neo4j graph exist

    // When the underlying repository is changed--
    // 1. A source file is modified.
    // 2. A new source file is added.
    // 3. An existing source file is deleted.
    // 4. An existing source file is renamed.

    // And the ScoutAgent is triggered again

    // Then the work_queue should only contain tasks for the modified file and the new file.
    // And the refactoring_tasks table should contain a 'DELETE' task for the deleted file.
    // And the refactoring_tasks table should contain a 'RENAME' task for the renamed file.

    // When the full pipeline (WorkerAgents, GraphIngestorAgent) is run

    // Then all tasks in work_queue and refactoring_tasks should be marked as completed/ingested.
    // And the Neo4j graph should be updated correctly--
    // - Nodes/relationships for the modified file are updated.
    // - Nodes/relationships for the new file are created.
    // - All nodes/relationships associated with the deleted file are removed.
    // - All nodes associated with the renamed file have their `filePath` and `qualifiedName` properties updated.
