/**
 * @file This test suite serves as the high-level, end-to-end acceptance gateway for the
 * Cognitive Triangulation architectural refactor.
 *
 * The tests defined here are intentionally broad and user-centric, focusing on validating
 * the complete, integrated system from an external perspective. They are the executable
 * embodiment of the project's ultimate success criteria.
 *
 * For detailed test case descriptions, including objectives, preconditions, steps, and
 * specific, AI-verifiable success criteria, please refer to the canonical test documentation:
 *
 * @see docs/tests/cognitive_triangulation_acceptance_tests.md
 *
 * This structured approach ensures that our testing is both rigorously defined and
 * directly tied to the project's strategic goals, as laid out in the Master
 * Acceptance Test Plan.
