    // AI-Verifiable Completion Criterion--
    // 1. All SQLite tasks (`work_queue`, `analysis_results`) are marked as completed/ingested.
    // 2. The `failed_work` table is empty.
    // 3. The final Neo4j graph is identical to the "golden" graph for the sample repository.

    // Given the pipeline has access to a clean, small sample code repository
    // And the SQLite database is empty
    // And the Neo4j database is empty
    // And the scout_state.json file is empty or non-existent

    // When the ScoutAgent is triggered on the repository

    // Then the work_queue table in SQLite should be populated with all relevant source files from the repository.
    // And the ScoutAgent should save a new state file with the correct content hashes for all processed files.

    // When the WorkerAgent pool is activated

    // Then all work_queue items should be processed and moved to 'completed' status.
    // And the analysis_results table should contain one record for each processed file.
    // And each llm_output should be a valid, structured JSON object adhering to the data contract.

    // When the GraphIngestorAgent is triggered

    // Then all analysis_results items should be moved to 'ingested' status.
    // And the Neo4j database should contain the correct nodes and relationships corresponding to the sample repository's structure.
    // And there should be no records in the refactoring_tasks table.
