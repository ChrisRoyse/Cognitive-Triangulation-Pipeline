**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check database connectivity
node -e "const db = require('better-sqlite3')('./data/database.db'); console.log(db.prepare('SELECT 1').get());"

# Solution: Verify database file permissions and path
```

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Check memory usage
node -e "console.log(process.memoryUsage());"

export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

**Permission Issues:**
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la ./data/
ls -la ./backups/

# Solution: Fix permissions
chmod 644 ./data/database.db
chmod 755 ./backups/
```

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Check database performance
node validate-consistency-fixes.js --performance-test
